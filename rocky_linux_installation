# Rocky Linux Installation From USB Drive
## Minimum Requirements
* USB drive: ≥8 GB.
* Target machine: 2 GB RAM (minimal) / 4 GB+ (GUI install).
## Create a Bootable Rocky Linux USB Drive
*  Download the ISO: https://rockylinux.org/download
    ** DVD ISO (full install with most packages) or 
    ** Minimal ISO (lighter, network install)
* Save the ISO to your Downloads directory (e.g., ~/Downloads/Rocky-10.0-x86_64-dvd1.iso)
* Identify your USB drive.
    ```bash
        lsblk
    ```
    ** Look for your USB device (e.g., /dev/sdb).
    ** WARNING: Double‑check the correct device — writing the image will erase it completely.
* Create the bootable USB
    ** WARNING: The following will wipe off any data existing inside the target device! Make you have backed up any data that you may have inside the USB.
    ```bash
        sudo dd if=~/Downloads/Rocky-10.0-x86_64-dvd1.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=4M status=progress oflag=sync
        sync
        sudo eject /dev/sdb
    ```
    ** Replace "/dev/sdX" with your USB device (e.g., /dev/sdb, NOT a partition like /dev/sdb1).

If all goes well, you should be able to see something similar to Figure 1 below at the end of the bootable USB creation for Rocky Linux.

* The Rocky Linux installer will start.
